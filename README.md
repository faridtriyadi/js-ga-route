# JavaScript-Based Genetic Algorithm for Route Optimization

This repository contains a client-side implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the shortest route problem (TSP variant).

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
2. Click "Run GA" to execute the algorithm.
3. View route data and fitness score in console (F12).

## Files

- `script.js`: Main GA functions
- `dataset.js`: Coordinate data
- `index.html`: Demo runner
